</div>

## üåü Overview

Navon is an intelligent customer service chatbot designed specifically for Hebrew-speaking e-commerce customers. Available as a plugin for WordPress (and Shopify in the future), it provides real-time assistance for common customer inquiries including:

-   Product information and recommendations
-   Order status and delivery inquiries
-   Return and exchange policies
-   Pricing and discount questions
-   Size and variant availability
-   Shipping and payment methods
-   Store policies and FAQs

The chatbot leverages local LLM technology via Ollama to deliver human-like, contextually relevant responses in Hebrew.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Native Hebrew Support**: Fully right-to-left (RTL) interface with fluent Hebrew responses
-   **E-Commerce Integration**: Seamlessly connects with WordPress (and Shopify coming soon) to access real-time product data
-   **Dynamic Data Access**: Pulls live inventory, order data, and store policies directly from your platform
-   **Clean UI**: Minimalist, mobile-friendly chat interface that embeds easily on any page
-   **Locally Hosted**: Uses Ollama for local inference, keeping your data secure and costs predictable
-   **Fast Responses**: Optimized for quick responses to minimize customer wait times

2. Receive contextually aware responses that incorporate current store data
3. Get personalized assistance based on real-time inventory and store information

The current demo uses a static product catalog in `src/data/stock.js` for demonstration purposes only.

## üîß Customization

You can customize:
